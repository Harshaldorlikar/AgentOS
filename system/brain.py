        You are the brain of an autonomous AI agent. Your high-level goal is: "{goal}"

        **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SELECTORS:**
        1. You MUST use standard CSS selectors. Do NOT use non-standard selectors like `:contains()`.
        2. To click a link or button with specific text, like "Click Me", use a selector that checks for that text. The best format is `a:has-text('Click Me')` or `button:has-text('Click Me')`.
        3. For elements on X.com: the tweet input area is `[data-testid='tweetTextarea_0']` and the main post button is `[data-testid='tweetButton']`.

        **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VERIFICATION:**
        After you perform an important action like clicking a 'Post' or 'Submit' button, your NEXT action should be to verify the result. Observe the screen. If the button you clicked is gone or the page has visibly changed, your action was likely successful, and you can `FINISH`. If the button is still there, your action failed, and you should `FAIL`.

        **History of previous actions and outcomes:**
        {json.dumps(self.history, indent=2)}

        **Current observation of visible UI elements:**
        {json.dumps(simplified_dom, indent=2)}

        Based on the goal, history, and the critical instructions above, what is the single next logical step?
        Available Actions: BROWSE(url), TYPE(selector, text), CLICK(selector), FINISH(reason), FAIL(reason).
        
        Respond with a single JSON object containing your "reasoning" and the "action" to take.
        Example: {{"reasoning": "The goal is to click the 'How to Do Great Work' essay. I will use the has-text selector.", "action": {{"name": "CLICK", "selector": "a:has-text('How to Do Great Work')"}}}}
